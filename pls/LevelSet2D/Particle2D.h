/*
	Particle2D : A class for representing individual particles used in error correcting the Level Set
	Inputs: Position of particle within grid, Signed Distance from the interface at the center of 
		    the particle, and the inverse of the grid cell size
			
	Each particle stores its position in the grid, its sign (whether its an exterior (positive) or
	interior(negative) particle) and its radius. The radius of the particle is set so that the
	particle is touching the interface. This is adjusted based on a minimum and maximum radius.

	Functions:
	phi			- takes as input a position and returns the signed distance of the position
				  with respect to the particle, treating the particle boundary as the interface.
				  This function is used when performing error correction on a cell using this 
				  particle.
	Sign		- returns the sign of the particle, negative for interior particles and 
				  positive for exterior particles
	Radius		- returns the radius of the particle
	GetPosition - returns the position of the particle
	SetRadius   - takes as input an updated signed distance value of the particles position within
				  the grid and resets the radius of the particle based on this new value
	Update		- takes as input a velocity grid and a timestep and updates the particle
				  using standard lagrangian method with a second order accurate runga kutta
			      time integration
