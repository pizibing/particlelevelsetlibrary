/*
	LevelSet: A class for representing and working with a 3D LevelSets
	Inputs: Grid size and cell size. For the sake of simplicity, cells are of uniform size
	
	Four different Grids are stored by the class at one time. 
	gridPhi  - contians the current levelset at any one time
	gridTemp - used for updating gridPhi
	gridPos  - used for error correction with escaped positive particles
	gridNeg  - used for error correction with escaped negative particles
	
	Finally a fastMarching grid is used for reinitializing the signed distance function

	Public Functions:
	Initialize		- This function has to be called before the simulation begins and is
					  used to initialize the level set grid values
	Update			- This function takes as input a velocity grid and timestep and updates
					  the levelset using a fast first order accurate semi-lagrangian update
	Fix				- Takes a particleSet as input and performs error correction on levelSet
	ReInitialize	- Reinitializes the grid to a signed distance grid using the fast
					  first order accurate fast marching method
	LinearSample	- Takes as input a Float position within the grid and uses the four 
					  surrounding cells for linearly interpolating the value of the 
					  LevelSet at that point
	CubicSample		- Same as LinearSample but uses Cubic interpolation. Although this is
					  more accurate, it is considerable more expensive
	eval			- A function used by Marching Cubes for visualization
			
	Private Functions:
	FixPos			- Takes as input a cell the contains error and the positive particle 
					  used to correct the value of the cell
	FixNeg			- Same as FixPos but used for negative escaped particles
	normal			- Calculates the normal at the given point. This is basically the 
					  normalized gradient
	gradient		- Calculated the gradient at the given point. if a velocity is given
					  it is used in the calculation of the gradient
	SemiLagrangiaStep   - Performs the first order accurate semi lagrangian step
